# Traffic Controller

Traffic Controller is a Cloud Foundry component that handles client requests
for logs and metrics. It gathers and collates messages from all
[Doppler](../doppler) servers, and provides an [external
API](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/noaa) and message translation.

Traffic Controller handles inbound HTTP and WebSocket requests for log and
metric data. It does this by proxying the request to all Dopplers (regardless
of AZ). Since an application can be deployed to multiple AZs, its logs can
potentially end up on Dopplers in multiple AZs. This is why the traffic
controller will attempt to connect to Dopplers in each AZ and will collate the
data into a single stream for the web socket client.

The Traffic Controller itself is stateless; an incoming request can be handled
by any instance in any AZ. As such, Traffic Controller is horizontally
scalable.

Traffic Controllers also expose a ```firehose``` web socket endpoint.
Connecting to this endpoint establishes connections to all Dopplers, and
streams logs and metrics for all applications and CF components. There are
firehose examples within the [NOAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/noaa)
library.

## Architecture Within Loggregator

![Loggregator Diagram](./trafficcontroller.png)

Logging data passes through the system as
[protocol-buffers](https://github.com/google/protobuf), using
[Dropsonde](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dropsonde).


## Usage

```
trafficcontoller [--logFile <path to log file>] \
    [--config <path to config file>] \
    [--cpuprofile <path to desired CPU profile>] \
    [--memprofile <path to desired memory profile>]
```

| Flag               | Required                               | Description                                     |
|--------------------|----------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------|
| ```--logFile```    | No, default: STDOUT                    | The agent log file.                             |
| ```--config``` | No, default: ```config/loggregator_trafficcontroller.json``` | Location of the Traffic Controller configuration JSON file. |
| ```--cpuprofile``` | No, default: no CPU profiling          | Write CPU profile to a file.                    |
| ```--memprofile``` | No, default: no memory profiling       | Write memory profile to a file.                 |
| ```--disableAccessControl``` | No, default: ```false```     | All clients' access to app logs                 |

## Editing Manifest Templates

The up-to-date Traffic-Controller configuration can be found [in the
Traffic-Controller spec file](../../jobs/loggregator_trafficcontroller/spec).
You can see a list of available configurable properties, their defaults and
descriptions in that file.

## Endpoints

Traffic Controller exposes a few endpoints from which clients like
[NOAA](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/noaa) use to obtain logs and metrics.

| Endpoint                      | Description                                                    |
|-------------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------|
|`/apps/APP_ID/stream`          | Opens a websocket connection that streams metrics and logs for the specified app ID. The types of available metrics are specified by [this function](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/dropsonde/blob/master/envelope_extensions/envelope_extensions.go#L12). Any metric or log that has an app ID will be sent.|
|`/apps/APP_ID/containermetrics`| Returns an HTTP response with the latest container metrics for the specified application. |
|`/firehose/SUBSCRIPTION_ID`    | Opens a websocket connection that streams the firehose. Connections with the same subscription id will get an equal portion of the firehose data.|
|`/set-cookie`                  | Sets a cookie with name and value obtained from FormValues `CookieName` and `CookieValue`. It also sets the headers `Access-Control-Allow-Credentials` and `Access-Control-Allow-Origin`.|
