Loggregator uses a microservices design architecture, with several distinct
components with the design goal of each component having a single metric to
scale that component horizontally. Specific scaling recommendations are
covered later in the document.

![Loggregator System Design](./loggregatornew.png) **note** this diagram
assumes the use of cf-deployment, cf-release is still using the following
[design](./loggregator.png).

## Ring Buffer Circuit Breaker
In order to prevent disrupting application
behavior or applying “backpressure” most of the Loggregator components share a
common ring buffer data structure known as a “diode”. This diode utilizes
separate read heads, and write heads and allows the components to handle
faster writes than reads from within the Loggregator system. Each of these
buffers emits metrics for ingress, egress, and dropped.

## Metron Agent
The metron agent process manages all ingress into the
Loggregator system and must be co-located with any job that wants to emit
metrics. The metron agent accomplishes this by listening on localhost for two
protocols. The UDP protocol supports the use of the dropsonde protocol which
is used to support many of the existing metrics on the platform. Recent
versions of Metron Agent now also support the use of the gRPC protocol using the
go-loggregator client. This new protocol is being used for application logs
from diego, and metrics from statsd-injector. Since this component is an agent
co-located with other processes on the platform there are no scaling
considerations.

## Statsd-injector
The statsd-injector is an optional job that
can be co-located with a process to support metrics using the statsd protocol.
This component is maintained by the Loggregator team and uses the gRPC ingress
point into Metron. Since this component is optionally co-located with the
specific processes it does not have scaling considerations.

## Doppler Forwarder
The doppler component acts as a highly-available routing mechanism for logs
and metrics flowing through loggregator. Each envelop that ingresses into
Doppler is duplicated, and routed to multiple destinations known as sinks. The
following is a breakdown of potential sinks each envelope can route to:

 - Logstream - The stream of logs used to support cf logs.
 - Firehose - The aggregated stream of application logs and metrics
 - Reverse Log Proxy - Reverse proxy for logs bound to syslog drains
 - Recent Logs Cache - An in memory store for recent logs from a particular
   application guid.
 - Container Metrics Cache - Container metrics for an application used during
   cf push.

Doppler scaling is complex, and relies on a variety of factors but,
primarily it scales with the overall log and metric volume on your platform.

## Traffic Controller
Traffic Controller manages the rate of egress from the
Loggregator system for the Firehose and 'cf logs' stream. Additionally it
provides the interface for container metrics and recent logs calls. Rather
than using a diode it does this by notifying the system of slow consumers.
