# Loggregator [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/cloudfoundry/loggregator.png?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/cloudfoundry/loggregator)

### Logging in the Clouds

Loggregator is the user application logging subsystem for Cloud Foundry.

### Features

Loggregator allows users to:

1. Tail their application logs.
1. Dump a recent set of application logs (where recent is on the order of an hour).
1. Continually drain their application logs to 3rd party log archive and analysis services.

### Usage
Proposed syntax:

```
cf logs [--space] [--app=APP_NAME|] [--tail]
```

``` bash
$ cf logs --tail

```

### Constraints

1. Loggregator collects STDOUT & STDERR from the customer's application.  This may require configuration on the developer's side.
1. A Loggregator outage must not affect the running application.
1. Loggregator gathers and stores logs in a best-effort manner.  While undesirable, losing the current buffer of application logs is acceptable.
1. As much as possible, Loggregator should be disconnected from the rest of Cloud Foundry.  Ideally, it's deployable outside of Cloud Foundry, entirely.
1. The 3rd party drain API should mimic Heroku's in order to reduce integration effort for our partners.  The Heroku drain API is simply remote syslog over TCP.

### Architecture

Loggregator is composed of:

* **Sources**: Logging agents that run on the Cloud Foundry components.  They forward logs to:
* **Loggregator Server**: Responsible for gathering logs from the **sources**, and storing in the temporary buffers.
* **Loggregator Sink Server**: Accepts connections from the `cf` CLI, allowing users to access their logs.
* **Loggregator Drain Server**: Implements the Heroku Drain API for 3rd party partners.

Source agents emit the logging data as [protocol-buffers](https://code.google.com/p/protobuf/), and the data stays in that format throughout the system.
