# Cloud Native Logging [![slack.cloudfoundry.org][slack-badge]][loggregator-slack] [![CI Badge][ci-badge]][ci-pipeline]

Loggregator is a [BOSH][bosh] release deployed as a part of
[cf-release][cf-release]. Loggregator provides
a highly-available (HA) and secure stream of logs and metrics for all
applications and components on Cloud Foundry. It does so while not disrupting
the behavior of the the applications and components on the platform (i.e.
"backpressure").

The [Loggregator Design Notes](docs/loggregator-design.md) presents an
overview of Loggregator components and architecture.

## Generating TLS Certificates

In order to secure transport of logs throughout the system, Loggregator needs
several certificates to be generated for each of the components. You start
this process by running the `scripts/generate-certs`, and then configure the
corresponding certificates for each of the components you are deploying. For
more details see our [Certificate Configuration README](docs/cert-config.md)

## Streaming Application Logs

Any user of Cloud Foundry can experience Loggregator by using two simple
interfaces for streaming application specific logs. These do not require any
special [User Account and Authentication(UAA)][uaa] Scope.

### Using the CF CLI

The fastest way to see your logs is by running the `cf logs` command using the
[CF CLI][cli]. Check the [Cloud Foundry CLI docs][cli-docs] for more details.

### Forwarding to a Log Drain

If you’d like to save all logs for an application in a third party or custom
tool that expects the syslog format, a log drain allows you to do so. Check
the [Cloud Foundry docs][cf-docs] for more details.

### Log Ordering

Loggregator does not provide any guaruntees around the order of delivery
of logs. Because Loggregator is a distributed system this means that logs
appear out of order in the stream. To improve this the CLI will hold and order
logs based on thier source timestamp as do most syslog servers. If you are using
Java a popular [work around exists using the Logback library](docs/java-multi-line-work-around.md).

## Consuming the Firehose

The firehose is an aggregated stream of all application logs and component
metrics on the platform. This allows operators to ensure they capture all logs
within a microservice architecture as well as monitor the health of their
platform. See the [Firehose README](docs/firehose.md).

### User Account and Authentication Scope

In order to consume the firehose you’ll need the `doppler.firehose` scope from
UAA. For more details see the [Firehose README](docs/firehose.md).

### Nozzle Development

Once you have configured appropriate authentication scope you are ready to
start developing a nozzle for the firehose. See our [Nozzle community
page](docs/community-nozzles.md) for more details about existing nozzles and
how to get started.

### Metrics

Loggregator and other Cloud Foundry components emit regular messages through
the Firehose that monitor the health, throughput, and details of a component's
operations. For more detials about Loggregator’s metrics see our [Loggregator
Metrics README](docs/metric_descriptions.md).

## Emitting Logs and Metrics into Loggregator

For components of Cloud Foundry or standalone BOSH deployments, Loggregator
provides a set of tools for emitting Logs and Metrics.

### Loggregator API

The Loggregator API is a replacement of the [Dropsonde
Protocol][dropsonde-protocol]. Loggregator API defines an envelope structure
which packages logs and metrics in a common format for distribution throughout
Loggregator. See the [Loggregator API README][api-readme] for more details.

### Including Metron

The Metron Agent listens on both UDP and gRPC endpoints for multiple versions
of Loggregator API which it forwards onto the Firehose. To include Metron in
your component or deployment see the [Setting up up Metron
README](docs/metron.md).

### Statsd-injector

The statsd-injector is a companion component to Metron and allows use of the
[statsd metric aggregator format][statsd-format]. For more see the
[statsd-injector README][statsd-injector-readme].

### Syslog Release

For some components (such as UAA) it makes sense to route logs separate from
the Firehose. The syslog release using rsyslog to accomplish this. For more
information see the [syslog-release README][syslog-release-readme] (note this
release is maintianed by the bosh team).

## Tools for Testing and Monitoring Loggregator

### Tools

Loggregator provides a set of tools for testing the
performance and reliability of your loggregator installation.
See the [loggregator tools](http://code.cloudfoundry.org/loggregator-tools)
repo for more details.

### Operator Guidebook
The [Loggregator Operator Guidebook](./docs/Loggregator%20Operator%20Guide.pdf) provides details for scaling
and managing Loggregator along with detailed results of capacity
planning tests.

## More Resources and Documentation

### Roadmap

We communicate our long term planning using a [Product Road Map](https://github.com/cloudfoundry/loggregator-release/projects/1),
and are always looking to gather feedback and input from Loggregator
operators. Get in touch or file an issue if you have feature suggestions you'd
like to see added.

### Pivotal Tracker

Items marked as "In Flight" on the Roadmap are tracked as new Features in
[Pivotal Tracker][loggregator-tracker].
